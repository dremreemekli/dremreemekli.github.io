  <h1>Assessing the Accuracy, Readability and Understandability of AI Answers on Radiation During Pregnancy</h1>

  <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burcu Mert, Emre Emekli</p>

  <p>
    This study evaluated the accuracy, readability, and understandability of answers provided by websites and AI-based chat tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard) to common patient questions about radiation exposure during pregnancy. Although most sources provided accurate responses, they generally fell short in readability and understandability for patients, with Bard performing best among the tested tools.

    <strong>Why this study matters:</strong><br />
    As artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Bard are increasingly used by patients to seek medical information, evaluating their clarity and reliability becomes essential. This study provides valuable insights into the current strengths and limitations of these tools in the sensitive context of radiation exposure during pregnancy. It emphasizes the urgent need for AI-generated health information to be both accurate and patient-friendly, especially when it concerns maternal and fetal safety.
