      <h2 class="mt-5">Why is this study important?</h2>
      <p>
        With the rise of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Bard, many patients now turn to AI chatbots for health-related information. However, while these tools can provide immediate answers, there are growing concerns about their medical accuracy, readability, and ability to be understood by a general audience. This study investigates how reliable these tools are in addressing one of the most sensitive medical topics: radiation exposure during pregnancy. Our findings help highlight both the potential and limitations of AI in patient education.
