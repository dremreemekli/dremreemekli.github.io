        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emre Emekli, Betül Nalan Karahan</p>

        <h2>Why is this study important?</h2>
        <p>This study addresses a critical gap in the integration of artificial intelligence into health professions education by objectively evaluating the quality of AI-generated multiple-choice questions (MCQs). As the manual development of high-quality MCQs demands significant time and expertise, the use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offers a promising solution to meet the growing need for extensive and regularly updated question banks. By comparing the difficulty and discrimination indices of AI-generated questions with those written by faculty experts in the context of radiography education, this research provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in assessment. The findings have significant implications for educators and curriculum developers seeking to enhance efficiency and innovation in educational assessment practices through AI integration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div>
  <p><strong>Background:</strong> High-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are essential for effective student assessment in health education. However, the manual creation of MCQs is labour-intensive, requiring significant time and expertise. With the increasing demand for large and continuously updated question banks, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has emerged as a potential tool for automating question generation. While AI-assisted question generation has shown promise, its ability to match human-authored MCQs in terms of difficulty and discrimination indices remains unclear. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of AI-generated and faculty-authored MCQs in radiography education, addressing a critical gap in evaluating AI's role in assessment processes. The findings will be beneficial for educators and curriculum designers exploring AI integration into health education.</p>

  <p><strong>Methods:</strong> This study was conducted in Turkey during the 2024–2025 academic year. Participants included 56 students enrolled in the first year of the Medical Imaging Programme. Two separate 30-question MCQ exams were developed—one generated by ChatGPT-4o and the other by a faculty member. The questions were derived from radiographic anatomy and positioning content, covering topics such as cranial, vertebral, pelvic, and lower extremity radiographs. Each exam contained six questions per topic, categorised into easy, medium, and difficult levels. A quantitative research design was employed. Students took both exams on separate days, without knowing the source of the questions. Difficulty and discrimination indices were calculated for each question, and student feedback was collected using a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate their perceptions of the exams.</p>

  <p><strong>Results:</strong> A total of 56 out of 80 eligible students participated, yielding a response rate of 70%. The mean number of correct answers are similar for ChatGPT (14.91 ± 4.25) and human expert exams (15.82 ± 4.73; p = 0.089). Exam scores showed moderate positive correlation (r = 0.628, p &lt; 0.001). ChatGPT achieved an average difficulty index of 0.50 versus 0.53 for human experts. Discrimination indices were acceptable for 73.33% of ChatGPT questions and 86.67% of human expert questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> LLMs like ChatGPT can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human expert questions, though slight limitations in discrimination and difficulty alignment remain. These models hold promise for supplementing assessment processes in health education.</p>
