        Evaluation of the Relationship Between Plantar Fascia and Achilles Tendon Measurements in Patients with Plantar Fasciitis
      </a>

  <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli, M. Alperen Kılıç, Murat Tepe</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study investigated the relationship between plantar fascia thickness and Achilles tendon morphology in patients with plantar fasciitis using MRI. Patients with plantar fasciitis demonstrated significantly increased plantar fascia thickness, Achilles tendon diameters, and higher rates of Achilles tendinopathy and retrocalcaneal bursitis compared with controls. These findings support a biomechanical linkage between the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon, highlighting the importance of comprehensive tendon–fascia assessment in plantar fasciitis.

  <p class="publication-authors">M. Alperen Kılıç, Hilal Kırmızıgül, Emre Emekli, Murat Tepe</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This case report presents a 38-year-old woman diagnosed with primary musculoskeletal hydatid disease involving the deltoid muscle and humerus, a rare manifestation of Echinococcus infection. MRI and CT imaging revealed multilocular cystic lesions causing bone destruction and soft-tissue invasion. Over ten years of follow-up, the lesion demonstrated minimal progression, underscoring the chronic nature and diagnostic challenges of primary musculoskeletal hydatidosis.

        Magnetic resonance imaging findings in Ménière’s disease: the impact of radiologist experience on hydrops imaging

  <p class="publication-authors">
    Çağatay Cihan, Uğur Toprak, Emre Emekli, Armağan İncesulu, Hamit İpek
  </p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study investigated how radiologist experience affects the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting endolymphatic hydrops in Ménière’s disease. 
    Sixty-four patients were evaluated by both a senior and a newly certified radiologist using 3D-FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences. 
    The experienced radiologist demonstrated higher intraobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy, while the newly certified radiologist showed lower consistency in hydrops assessment. 
    The findings emphasize that accurate evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops depends strongly on radiologist expertise and that structured training is needed to ensure diagnostic reliability.

        AI Teaches Surgical Diagnostic Reasoning to Medical Students: Evidence from an Experiment Using a Fully Automated, Low-Cost Feedback System

  <p class="publication-authors">Yavuz Selim Kıyak, Emre Emekli, Tuğba İş Kara, Özlem Coşkun, Işıl İrem Budakoğlu</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This prospective, parallel-group interventional study investigated the effectiveness of a fully automated AI-based system that generated both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and personalized feedback without human input to improve surgical diagnostic reasoning in preclinical medical students. Conducted at Gazi University, the AI-generated training covered five abdominal pain diagnoses and was assessed using an Objective Structured Video Examination (OSVE). Students in the intervention group significantly outperformed controls immediately and after two weeks (p &lt; 0.001). Expert review confirmed the accuracy of all AI-generated content with minimal feedback errors (0.6%), and the total AI cost was just $0.51. The findings suggest that lightweight, low-cost AI systems can effectively enhance diagnostic reasoning early in medical education, offering scalable and accessible tools for clinical learning.

        Artificial intelligence in radiology examinations: a psychometric comparison of question generation methods
      </a>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli, Betül Nalan Karahan</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study compared artificial intelligence (AI)-based question generation methods—ChatGPT-4o and a template-based automatic item generation (AIG) system—with faculty-written multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in radiology education. Conducted with 115 fifth-year medical students, the study found that both AI methods produced questions with acceptable psychometric properties, including difficulty and discrimination indices comparable to human-written items. Template-based AIG questions demonstrated particularly strong consistency and clarity ratings from students. Faculty-written questions yielded the highest overall performance, but AI-generated questions were rated highly in clarity, plausibility of distractors, and educational alignment. The findings suggest that AI-driven MCQ generation—especially template-based systems—can support educators in creating valid, high-quality assessment items efficiently, though expert oversight remains essential for quality assurance.

  <p class="publication-authors">Betül Nalan Karahan, Emre Emekli</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This comparative study evaluated multiple-choice questions (MCQs) generated by seven AI-based chatbots—including Claude 3, ChatGPT-4o, Copilot, Gemini, Turin Q, and Writesonic—for medical imaging education. 
    Eighty questions were analyzed for accuracy, difficulty, and discrimination indices through expert review and psychometric testing with students and radiology assistants. 
    Results showed that 72.5% of AI-generated questions were suitable for educational use, with most assessing recall-level knowledge (79.31%). 
    Claude 3 produced the most reliable and balanced questions, while some models generated easier or less discriminating items. 
    The study concluded that AI chatbots can effectively assist educators in creating valid MCQs for radiology education, although human review remains essential for higher cognitive domains and accuracy.

        Analysis of Clinical Record-Keeping Education in Turkish Medical Faculties: Evaluation of Curriculum Programs

  </p>
  <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli, M. Alperen Kılıç, Özlem Coşkun</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study analyzed the distribution and characteristics of clinical record-keeping (CRK) courses in Turkish medical faculties. 
    Curricula from 122 faculties were reviewed, and 86 programs were evaluated. Of the 1351 total CRK-related course hours, 
    31.8% were theoretical and 9.6% practical during the preclinical period, while 58.7% were theoretical during the clinical period. 
    Most courses focused on taking medical history (70.8%), followed by forensic document preparation and prescription writing. 
    Practical courses on discharge summaries and electronic health records were very limited. 
    The study highlights the need to increase the number and quality of practical CRK courses, particularly in the preclinical phase, 
    to strengthen students’ documentation competencies and improve patient safety after graduation.

  <p class="publication-description">
    This study is the first in Turkey to develop Turkish case-based psychiatry questions using a template-based automatic item generation (AIG) method. A total of 1,189 multiple-choice questions were generated with the aim of assessing clinical reasoning skills. The results demonstrated that high-quality and diverse questions can be produced efficiently using this approach. This work contributes significantly to psychiatric education and medical assessment practices.

  <p class="publication-description">
    This study compared multiple-choice questions (MCQs) generated by ChatGPT-4o with those written by radiology educators, focusing on difficulty and discrimination indices. Conducted with 56 first-year students in Turkey, both sets of questions covered radiographic anatomy and positioning. Results showed that AI-generated questions were comparable in quality to human-written ones, with minor differences in performance metrics. These findings highlight the potential of AI tools to support assessment processes in health education.

  <p class="publication-description">
    This study evaluates the accuracy, readability, and understandability of answers provided by websites, ChatGPT, Copilot, and Bard regarding radiation exposure during pregnancy. Although AI tools like Bard showed high accuracy and better readability, the overall results indicate that both websites and chatbots often provide information that is difficult for patients to understand. The study highlights the need for improving online health information to ensure accessibility for all readers.
