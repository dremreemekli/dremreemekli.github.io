        Artificial intelligence in radiology examinations: a psychometric comparison of question generation methods
      </a>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli, Betül Nalan Karahan</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study compared artificial intelligence (AI)-based question generation methods—ChatGPT-4o and a template-based automatic item generation (AIG) system—with faculty-written multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in radiology education. Conducted with 115 fifth-year medical students, the study found that both AI methods produced questions with acceptable psychometric properties, including difficulty and discrimination indices comparable to human-written items. Template-based AIG questions demonstrated particularly strong consistency and clarity ratings from students. Faculty-written questions yielded the highest overall performance, but AI-generated questions were rated highly in clarity, plausibility of distractors, and educational alignment. The findings suggest that AI-driven MCQ generation—especially template-based systems—can support educators in creating valid, high-quality assessment items efficiently, though expert oversight remains essential for quality assurance.
