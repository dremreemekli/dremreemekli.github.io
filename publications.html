  <p class="publication-description">
    This study investigated how radiologist experience affects the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting endolymphatic hydrops in Ménière’s disease. 
    Sixty-four patients were evaluated by both a senior and a newly certified radiologist using 3D-FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences. 
    The experienced radiologist demonstrated higher intraobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy, while the newly certified radiologist showed lower consistency in hydrops assessment. 
    The findings emphasize that accurate evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops depends strongly on radiologist expertise and that structured training is needed to ensure diagnostic reliability.

  <p class="publication-authors">Yavuz Selim Kıyak, Emre Emekli, Tuğba İş Kara, Özlem Coşkun, Işıl İrem Budakoğlu</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This prospective, parallel-group interventional study investigated the effectiveness of a fully automated AI-based system that generated both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and personalized feedback without human input to improve surgical diagnostic reasoning in preclinical medical students. Conducted at Gazi University, the AI-generated training covered five abdominal pain diagnoses and was assessed using an Objective Structured Video Examination (OSVE). Students in the intervention group significantly outperformed controls immediately and after two weeks (p &lt; 0.001). Expert review confirmed the accuracy of all AI-generated content with minimal feedback errors (0.6%), and the total AI cost was just $0.51. The findings suggest that lightweight, low-cost AI systems can effectively enhance diagnostic reasoning early in medical education, offering scalable and accessible tools for clinical learning.

        Artificial intelligence in radiology examinations: a psychometric comparison of question generation methods

  </p>
  <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli, Betül Nalan Karahan</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study compared artificial intelligence (AI)-based question generation methods—ChatGPT-4o and a template-based automatic item generation (AIG) system—with faculty-written multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in radiology education. Conducted with 115 fifth-year medical students, the study found that both AI methods produced questions with acceptable psychometric properties, including difficulty and discrimination indices comparable to human-written items. Template-based AIG questions demonstrated particularly strong consistency and clarity ratings from students. Faculty-written questions yielded the highest overall performance, but AI-generated questions were rated highly in clarity, plausibility of distractors, and educational alignment. The findings suggest that AI-driven MCQ generation—especially template-based systems—can support educators in creating valid, high-quality assessment items efficiently, though expert oversight remains essential for quality assurance.

  <p class="publication-description">
    This comparative study evaluated multiple-choice questions (MCQs) generated by seven AI-based chatbots—including Claude 3, ChatGPT-4o, Copilot, Gemini, Turin Q, and Writesonic—for medical imaging education. 
    Eighty questions were analyzed for accuracy, difficulty, and discrimination indices through expert review and psychometric testing with students and radiology assistants. 
    Results showed that 72.5% of AI-generated questions were suitable for educational use, with most assessing recall-level knowledge (79.31%). 
    Claude 3 produced the most reliable and balanced questions, while some models generated easier or less discriminating items. 
    The study concluded that AI chatbots can effectively assist educators in creating valid MCQs for radiology education, although human review remains essential for higher cognitive domains and accuracy.

        Analysis of Clinical Record-Keeping Education in Turkish Medical Faculties: Evaluation of Curriculum Programs

  <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli, M. Alperen Kılıç, Özlem Coşkun</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study analyzed the distribution and characteristics of clinical record-keeping (CRK) courses in Turkish medical faculties. 
    Curricula from 122 faculties were reviewed, and 86 programs were evaluated. Of the 1351 total CRK-related course hours, 
    31.8% were theoretical and 9.6% practical during the preclinical period, while 58.7% were theoretical during the clinical period. 
    Most courses focused on taking medical history (70.8%), followed by forensic document preparation and prescription writing. 
    Practical courses on discharge summaries and electronic health records were very limited. 
    The study highlights the need to increase the number and quality of practical CRK courses, particularly in the preclinical phase, 
    to strengthen students’ documentation competencies and improve patient safety after graduation.

      Relationship Between Medial Meniscus Extrusion and Damage to Medial Stabilizers: Should Extrusion be Considered Significant Only when More Than 3 mm?
    </a>
  </p>
  <p class="publication-authors">Hasan Ali Ekşili, Uğur Toprak, Emre Emekli</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study investigates the relationship between medial meniscus extrusion (MM-ME) and various factors like age, weight, osteoarthritis (OA), and ligament damage. It identifies significant correlations, suggesting that MM-ME values between 2.49–2.85 mm could indicate damage to the meniscus, meniscofemoral and meniscotibial ligaments, as well as OA. The findings emphasize the importance of MM-ME measurements in assessing knee joint health and guiding treatment decisions.

      The Relationship of Renal Augmented Velocity Index With Ventricular-Arterial Coupling in Comparison to Renal Resistive Index Analysis by Means of Arterial and Ventricular Elastances in Hypertensive Patients
    </a>
  </p>
  <p class="publication-authors">Betül Banu Karasu, Emre Emekli</p>
  <p class="publication-description">
    This study explores the subtle cardiorenal interaction in hypertensive patients by examining the relationship between renal augmented velocity index (Avi) and ventriculoarterial coupling, even before conventional cardiac and renal parameters show abnormalities. The findings suggest that renal Avi is a more sensitive and reliable indicator of subclinical changes in cardiorenal circulation than renal resistive index (RI), highlighting its potential in early detection and management of cardiorenal dysfunction.

The study highlights that RSH, typically a rare and self-limiting condition, has become more common and potentially fatal due to the increased use of anticoagulants during the COVID-19 pandemic. It emphasizes the need for healthcare providers to consider RSH in patients with risk factors and acute abdominal pain, with ultrasound as the preferred diagnostic tool, supplemented by CT when necessary.</p>

            <p class="publication-authors">Emre Emekli , Uğur Toprak , Suzan Şaylısoy , Lütfiye Demir</p>
            <p class="publication-description"> Bu makale, boyun bölgesinde nadir görülen bir ekstraosseöz Ewing sarkomu vakasını ele alıyor. Çalışma, görüntülemenin bu tür tümörlerin cerrahi yönlendirilmesi ve evrelendirilmesindeki önemini vurgularken, erken tanı ve tam cerrahi rezeksiyonun sağkalım oranlarını artırdığına dikkat çekmektedir. Bu nedenle, hızla büyüyen boyun kitlelerinin ayırıcı tanısında Ewing sarkomu göz önünde bulundurulmalıdır.</p>
